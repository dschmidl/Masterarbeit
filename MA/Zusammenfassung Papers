"The influence of controllers on immersion in mobile games", "Cairns, Paul, Li, Jing Wang, WendyNordin, A Imran:

Capturing Gaming Experiences 
- Gaming Experience Questionnaire (GExpQ)
- PENS scale (?)
- Immersive Experience Questionnaire (IEQ) für Immersion

Different types of controls:
1.  directional  natural  mapping,  where  the  directions  on  the controller match the results in the game such as use of a joystick (or touching)
2.  kinesic natural mapping, where physical movements correspond  to  real-life  actions  even  if  not  realistically  like Sony’s Air Guitar
3.  Incomplete tangible natural mapping, where the movement of the controls correspond to the movement of a real object like Guitar Hero (or tilting for example, WiiMote as a racket)
4.  Realistic tangible natural mapping, where there is a physical controller that corresponds to a real object like a steering wheel for a driving game (or a real ice hockey stick for gaming)

--> Skalski et al.  identified that both in a golf game and a driving game, where the mapping of controls were more natural, both spatial presence and enjoyment of the game was higher.

Steering wheel more fun, but better driving results were achieved with a thumbstick (in a driving game)

"Developing Iconic and Semi-Iconic Game Controllers" Lennart E. Nacke, João P. Costa, Dennis L. Kappen, James Robb, Daniel Buckstein

Different forms of controller:
- symbolic: Xbox controller for example
- iconic: maps visual game objects on the actual game controller (here: balloons)
- semi-iconic: here: similar to iconic balloon controller, but in different colors

"Measuring the Impact of Game Controllers on Player Experience in FPS Games" Kathrin M. Gerling, Matthias Klauser, Joerg Niesenhaus 

nine dimensions of enjoyment  in video games were identified, namely:  
- Flow
-Imaginative and Sensory Immersion
- Competenc
e- Suspense
- Negative   Affect
- Control and  Social Presence
-->Based on these Nine UX Dimensions, the Game Experience Questionnaire was developed	

Game Engagement Queationnaire (GEnQ) by Brockmyer: designed to explore player engagement in video games and examines the dimensions Immersion, Presence, Flow and Absorption

ISO-Norm  Questionnaire  
9241/10

Beispielhypothesen: 
The  hardware  interface  influences  the player’s  experienceand  efficiency  (1),  player  efficiency  has  an  impact on player experience (2) 
using one’s comfort platform will influence player experience (3).

"Exertion in the Small: Improving Differentiation and Expressiveness in Sports Games with Physical Controls"

Drawbacks for sports games with usual controllers:
- limited opportunity for expertise development: skill in the game can be increased, but not basic physical skills like running or throwing for real-world sports
- little differentiation between players in terms of basic actions (running, passing) --> real-world sports often revolve around individual differences
- artifical simplicity of controller actions means that there is no change in a player's physical capabilities over the course of a game (fatigue often decides games in real world sports)

Playing sports video games can improve performance in the real-world sport counterpart. Previous knowledge of a sport can affect success in playung sports video games.

The study provided four main findings:
1. physical controls allowed expertise development over time, particularly for precise passing in JellyPolo
2. Impulse-based control of movement led to clear individual differences in player abilities, in both TaFR (keyboard input) and JellyPolo (controller input)
3. Physical movement control also clearly led to changes in player capabilites over time, with fatigue becoming a major factor in both game outcomes and game strategy
4. Physical control appeared to add to the complexity and unpredictability of JellyPolo, leading to greater player expressiveness, enjoyment, and enthusiasm

"Towards a framework of player experience research"

Jordan (Jordan,  P.  W.  Pleasure  with  Products:  Human  Factors for Body, Mind and Soul. In Human Factors in Product Design:  Current  Practise  and  Future  Trends.  Taylor  & Francis(1999), 206-217.) developed a model of user needs based in Maslow's motivational model of human needs. In this model, pleasure follows from usability, which follows from funtionality. There are 4 types of pleasure:
1. psycho-pleasure (cognitive and emotional reactions)
2. physio-pleasure (evoked tactile and olfactory stimuli)
3. socio-pleasure (evoked by relationships, society, personal status or indicative of social identity)
4. ideo-pleasure (aesthetics and ideological value)

Designing Sports: A Framework for Exertion Games

Four lenses (Jacob et. al):
Lens 1 - The responding body: 
	a view of the body "from the inside" or how the body's internal state changes over time as a result of the exertion - any activity from an outer layer necessitates a physiological response from the inner layer (heart rate increases, sweating, heavier breathing)
Lens 2 - The moving body:
	focuses on participants' muscular repostioning of body parts relative to one another during the course of physical activity. It highlights movement characteristics such as intensity (movement can carry "weight"), continousness (movement exhibits preparatory and follow-through phases) and variety (the richness of human movement).
Lens 3 - The sensing body
	describes how the body is sensing and experiencing the world. The physical and technological environment shapes the activity - playing in a stadium is not the same as playing in the park, nor is running in a park the same as running on a treadmill. The sensing body therefore aims to offer a contextual perspective, highlighting the body and its interactions with the world.
Lens 4 - The relating body
	encompasses the ways in which bodies and people relate to each other through digital technology (co-player, opponents, audience, etc.).
